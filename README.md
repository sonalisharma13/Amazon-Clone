# Amazon-Clone
My first project to using just html and css.
<br> Feature : 
<br> -Product listing: Browser through an array of products displayed on the clone.
<br> -Basic Styling: Employed CSS to make the interface resemble the Amazon website.
<br> -Hover Effect is used whenever mouse hovers through it.
